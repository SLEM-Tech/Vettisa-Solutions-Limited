          4. Missing Items & Supplier Discrepancies
        </h3>
        <p>
          At V Import, we act as your dedicated procurement agent. While we vet
          suppliers, we do not control their internal packing process. In the
          rare event that a supplier fails to ship an item or sends an
          incomplete order, the following policy applies:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Re-order Protocol:</strong> Our primary resolution for
            missing items is an automatic Re-order. We will immediately engage
            the supplier to ship the missing item in our next available cargo
            batch at no additional service charge to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternative Resolution:</strong> If the item is out of stock
            or time-sensitive, the value of the missing item will be converted
            into a Store Credit/Wallet Balance for your future procurement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refund Exception:</strong> Cash refunds for missing items
            are only processed if the supplier confirms they cannot fulfill the
            order and has refunded the funds to our corporate account. Please
            allow 5–7 business days for international payment reversals to
            reflect.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <p className="mt-4">
        <strong>Important Note:</strong> To claim a missing item, a continuous{" "}
        <strong>Unboxing Video</strong> (from the moment the seal is broken
        until every item is counted) is mandatory. Without this video, we cannot
        file a dispute with the international supplier on your behalf.
